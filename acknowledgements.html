"My father is 52 years old now. He entered The US at the age of 16 with a 3rd grade education. He has always been a hard worker and had been trying to obtain residency since I could remember. He was deported 4 years ago. My younger brothers were 2 and 16 at the time and I was 20. My brother got a job to help pay bills along with me and my older sister. My 2 year old brother is going to be 7 now and barely even knows who our dad is. I have helped raise him and took both of my brothers under my wing. I graduated from a technical college the year he was deported and now I am back in college and plan to obtain a degree in teaching. My father didn't raise criminals, he set examples of what hard work can accomplish. We never received government help and he always paid his taxes. So my question is why not look further into his history here rather than just assume anybody here "illegally," is in fact not worthy of living and thriving in this unjust but beautiful country."

   "I met my husband a Mexican national in 2007 after having our daughter. We wanted to fix his status as he was illegal. He left the states in 2011 and was given a 10 year bar from reentering the US with no waiver. Living a nightmare of trying to keep our marriage together our kids happy and the inflow of money to the family. We will not be allowed to live normal until 2021. Immigration has robbed me of my children's daily growth and amazing first memories as I travel between Mexico and San Diego weekly. I simply want to see and hold my children daily and have the daily support of my amazing husband. Immigration is such a cold inhumane process. It's tearing families apart when it should be uniting them."

 "Born in Ethiopia, my father fled government persecution and lived in a refugee camp before being relocated to Atlanta, where he worked in an umbrella factory and lived on beans, rice and cigarettes. He then moved to Los Angeles, scraped through college, began a career and married my white mom, a social worker from San Diego.

Rather than find a job that was stable or high-paying, he decided to go into the nonprofit world assisting other refugees, eventually becoming a political appointee in the Obama administration and running the entire federal immigration office himself.

While his reputation has preceded him in many ways, it often fell on deaf ears while I was growing up - his story was just too complicated and didn't resonated with my very whitewashed high school and university friends. That's not to say that many of my friends did not profoundly respect him and welcome me in as their token nonwhite friend, but being the constant outlier meant those tapes in my head were ready to go whenever I needed to play them."

 "I was brought to the U.S. at seven years old by my immigrant parents. I've now lived in America for 17 years. Being an illegal immigrant means living in fear of deportation; there is no promise of security. My 19-year-old brother was deported when I was 17, and my family has never been the same since. It's been seven years now that I haven't seen him and don't know if I ever will. In 2012, I was given the opportunity to come out of the shadows as an illegal immigrant and become a "Dreamer" (under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a.k.a DACA). Despite the displacement of my brother, I gained the peace of mind knowing that, for four years, I would be protected from deportation. DACA has given me the opportunity to work and go to school. I paid for my bachelor's degree out of my own pocket (no student loans, no government assistance). I can't tell you how disheartening it is to feel like the President doesn't support the Dreamers. My family and I have made so many sacrifices to be here in the U.S.; I deserve an opportunity to demonstrate that I can be an American citizen. I am a first-generation college graduate, currently excelling in my corporate position. I am not a criminal - I've never even had a traffic violation. I go through background checks, I pay my taxes and all other fees required as a DACA recipient. Despite all my efforts to my community and to this country, the President doesn't believe that I am up to par to be a law-abiding citizen. The U.S. is the only home I have ever known, and no DACA means losing everything I have ever worked toward."

       "These hands have held
        Three children as they breathed their last,
        Before bringing her family to America
        Leaving comfort in the past.
      </pre>
      <pre>
        These hands have worked steadily
        Since their arrival,
        For a country that now turns a blind eye
        To those depending on it for survival.
      </pre>
      <pre>
        These hands are my grandmother's,
        Who not too long ago was a refugee,
        A person displaced by war and decisions
        She didn't make willingly
      </pre>
      <pre>
        These hands mean more to me than bans
        Or detainment or laws.
        They mean enough for me to stand
        And fight for a greater cause.
      </pre>
      <pre>
        Where is our humanity?
        Have we lost it all?
        Have we forgotten upon whose backs
        We built this country that now
      </pre>
      <pre>
        Divides with walls?
        We cannot lose our benevolence,
        Our will to understand, for
        It is our commission as human beings
        To lend a helping hand"
