      A researcher told "CBS This Morning" that at the Clint facility, about 20 miles southeast of El Paso, more than a dozen children had the flu, and that some were in quarantine cells without adult supervision. The researcher added that young girls were taking care of a sick two-year-old boy who was in filthy clothing without a diaper,
       and that children said they were fed uncooked frozen food and had gone weeks without bathing. CBS News reached out to immigration officials, and has not yet heard back.
       Apprehensions in the El Paso border area have spiked more than 600% since last year. In May, the Office of the inspector General pointed to dangerous overcrowding at the El Paso facility, showing migrants packed into holding cells." <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-at-border-facility-children-living-inhumane-conditions-texas-border-facility-doctors-attorneys-say/"> [ ... ]</a></left></h3>
